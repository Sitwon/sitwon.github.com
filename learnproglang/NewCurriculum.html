               <h1>A better curriculum for teaching Computer Programming</h1>

<h2>Idea</h2>

<p>When I was very young (elementary school) one of the ways I first learned about programming was through programming games such as <a href="http://www.tacticalneuronics.com/content/aiw3dnew.asp">A.I. Wars</a>. I think competitive games could be an excellent tool for teaching computer programming to both children and adults.</p>

<p>There are several freeware or open-source programming games available today which look promising.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.corewars.org/">Core Wars</a> - Assembly-like programming language</li>
<li><a href="http://robowar.sourceforge.net/RoboWar5/index.html">RoboWar</a> - Stack-oriented programming language</li>
<li><a href="http://robocode.sourceforge.net/">Robocode</a> - Java or .Net languages</li>
<li><a href="http://www.battlecode.org/">Battlecode</a> - Java languages (don't see any source code yet)</li>
</ul>

<p>What I am proposing is developing a curriculum based on (or inspired by) these games. </p>

<h2>Proposed Curriculum</h2>

<p>Stage 1: Introduction to programming with Robo<a href=""></a>War (teach a very simple programming language)</p>

<p>Stage 2: Introduction to high-level programming with Robocode (teach a higher-level programming language)</p>

<p>Stage 3: TECS Part 1: Assembly language. (Based on the first half of "The Elements of Computing Systems", it would teach how to create a machine to run Core Wars battles.)</p>

<p>Stage 4: TECS Part 2: Higher-level lanaguage. (Based on the second half of "The Elements of Computing Systems", it would teach how to create a game like Robocode or Battlecode.)</p>

<p>This could probably be broken up into 4 single semester courses.</p>
